<p>This book aims to explain Futures in Rust using an example driven approach,
exploring why they're designed the way they are, and how they work. We'll also
take a look at some of the alternatives we have when dealing with concurrency
in programming.</p>
<p>Going into the level of detail I do in this book is not needed to use futures
or async/await in Rust. It's for the curious out there that want to know <em>how</em>
it all works.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-book-covers"><a class="header" href="#what-this-book-covers">What this book covers</a></h2>
<p>This book will try to explain everything you might wonder about up until the
topic of different types of executors and runtimes. We'll just implement a very
simple runtime in this book introducing some concepts but it's enough to get
started.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stjepang">Stjepan Glavina</a> has made an excellent series of
articles about async runtimes and executors, and if the rumors are right there
is more to come from him in the near future.</p>
<p>The way you should go about it is to read this book first, then continue
reading the <a href="https://stjepang.github.io/">articles from stjepang</a> to learn more
about runtimes and how they work, especially:</p>

</ol>
<p>I've limited myself to a 200 line main example (hence the title) to limit the
scope and introduce an example that can easily be explored further.</p>
<p>However, there is a lot to digest and it's not what I would call easy, but we'll
take everything step by step so get a cup of tea and relax.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the ride.</p>

<p>Before we go into the details about Futures in Rust, let's take a quick look
at the alternatives for handling concurrent programming in general and some
pros and cons for each of them.</p>
<p>While we do that we'll also explain some aspects when it comes to concurrency which
will make it easier for us when we dive into Futures specifically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For fun, I've added a small snippet of runnable code with most of the examples.
If you're like me, things get way more interesting then and maybe you'll see some
things you haven't seen before along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="threads-provided-by-the-operating-system"><a class="header" href="#threads-provided-by-the-operating-system">Threads provided by the operating system</a></h2>
<p>Now, one way of accomplishing concurrent programming is letting the OS take care
of everything for us. We do this by simply spawning a new OS thread for each
task we want to accomplish and write code like we normally would.</p>
<p>The runtime we use to handle concurrency for us is the operating system itself.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Switching between tasks is reasonably fast</li>
<li>You get parallelism for free</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OS level threads come with a rather large stack. If you have many tasks
waiting simultaneously (like you would in a web server under heavy load) you'll
run out of memory pretty fast.</li>
<li>There are a lot of syscalls involved. This can be pretty costly when the number
of tasks is high.</li>
<li>The OS has many things it needs to handle. It might not switch back to your
thread as fast as you'd wish.</li>
<li>Might not be an option on some systems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using OS threads in Rust looks like this:</strong></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::thread;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;So we start the program here!&quot;);
    let t1 = thread::spawn(move || {
        thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(200));
        println!(&quot;We create tasks which gets run when they're finished!&quot;);
    });

    let t2 = thread::spawn(move || {
        thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
        println!(&quot;We can even chain callbacks...&quot;);
        let t3 = thread::spawn(move || {
            thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(50));
            println!(&quot;...like this!&quot;);
        });
        t3.join().unwrap();
    });
    println!(&quot;While our tasks are executing we can do other stuff here.&quot;);

    t1.join().unwrap();
    t2.join().unwrap();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>OS threads sure have some pretty big advantages. So why all this talk about
&quot;async&quot; and concurrency in the first place?</p>
<p>First, for computers to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency"><em>efficient</em></a> they need to multitask. Once you
start to look under the covers (like <a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/async-await/">how an operating system works</a>)
you'll see concurrency everywhere. It's very fundamental in everything we do.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have the web.</p>
<p>Web servers are all about I/O and handling small tasks
(requests). When the number of small tasks is large it's not a good fit for OS
threads as of today because of the memory they require and the overhead involved
when creating new threads.</p>
<p>This gets even more problematic when the load is variable which means the current number of tasks a
program has at any point in time is unpredictable. That's why you'll see so many async web
frameworks and database drivers today.</p>
<p>However, for a huge number of problems, the standard OS threads will often be the
right solution. So, just think twice about your problem before you reach for an
async library.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at some other options for multitasking. They all have in common
that they implement a way to do multitasking by having a &quot;userland&quot;
runtime.</p>
<h2 id="green-threadsstackful-coroutines"><a class="header" href="#green-threadsstackful-coroutines">Green threads/stackful coroutines</a></h2>
<p>In this book I'll use the term &quot;green threads&quot; to mean stackful coroutines to differentiate
them from the other continuation mechanisms described in this chapter. You can, however, see
the term &quot;green threads&quot; be used to describe a broader set of continuation mechanisms in different
littrature or discussions on the internet.</p>
<p>Green threads use the same mechanism as an OS - creating a thread for
each task, setting up a stack, saving the CPU's state, and jumping from one
task(thread) to another by doing a &quot;context switch&quot;.</p>
<p>We yield control to the scheduler (which is a central part of the runtime in
such a system) which then continues running a different task.</p>
<p>Rust had green threads once, but they were removed before it hit 1.0. The state
of execution is stored in each stack so in such a solution there would be no
need for <code>async</code>, <code>await</code>, <code>Future</code> or <code>Pin</code>. In many ways, green threads mimics how
an operating system facilitates concurrency, and implementing them is a great
learning experience. </p>
<p><strong>The typical flow looks like this:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Run some non-blocking code.</li>
<li>Make a blocking call to some external resource.</li>
<li>CPU &quot;jumps&quot; to the &quot;main&quot; thread which schedules a different thread to run and
&quot;jumps&quot; to that stack.</li>
<li>Run some non-blocking code on the new thread until a new blocking call or the
task is finished.</li>
<li>CPU &quot;jumps&quot; back to the &quot;main&quot; thread, schedules a new thread which is ready
to make progress, and &quot;jumps&quot; to that thread.</li>
</ol>
<p>These &quot;jumps&quot; are known as <strong>context switches</strong>. Your OS is doing it many times each
second as you read this.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Simple to use. The code will look like it does when using OS threads.</li>
<li>A &quot;context switch&quot; is reasonably fast.</li>
<li>Each stack only gets a little memory to start with so you can have hundreds of
thousands of green threads running.</li>
<li>It's easy to incorporate <a href="https://cfsamson.gitbook.io/green-threads-explained-in-200-lines-of-rust/green-threads#preemptive-multitasking"><em>preemption</em></a>
which puts a lot of control in the hands of the runtime implementors.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The stacks might need to grow. Solving this is not easy and will have a cost.</li>
<li>You need to save the CPU state on every switch.</li>
<li>It's not a <em>zero cost abstraction</em> (Rust had green threads early on and this
was one of the reasons they were removed).</li>
<li>Complicated to implement correctly if you want to support many different
platforms.</li>
</ol>
<p>A green threads example could look something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The example presented below is an adapted example from an earlier gitbook I
wrote about green threads called <a href="https://cfsamson.gitbook.io/green-threads-explained-in-200-lines-of-rust/">Green Threads Explained in 200 lines of Rust.</a>
If you want to know what's going on you'll find everything explained in detail
in that book. The code below is wildly unsafe and it's just to show a real example.
It's not in any way meant to showcase &quot;best practice&quot;. Just so we're on
the same page.</p>

<p>Still hanging in there? Good. Don't get frustrated if the code above is
difficult to understand. If I hadn't written it myself I would probably feel
the same. You can always go back and read the book which explains it later.</p>
<h2 id="callback-based-approaches"><a class="header" href="#callback-based-approaches">Callback based approaches</a></h2>
<p>You probably already know what we're going to talk about in the next paragraphs
from JavaScript which I assume most know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your exposure to JavaScript callbacks has given you any sorts of PTSD earlier
in life, close your eyes now and scroll down for 2-3 seconds. You'll find a link
there that takes you to safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole idea behind a callback based approach is to save a pointer to a set of
instructions we want to run later together with whatever state is needed. In Rust this
would be a <code>closure</code>. In the example below, we save this information in a <code>HashMap</code>
but it's not the only option.</p>
<p>The basic idea of <em>not</em> involving threads as a primary way to achieve concurrency
is the common denominator for the rest of the approaches. Including the one
Rust uses today which we'll soon get to.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to implement in most languages</li>
<li>No context switching</li>
<li>Relatively low memory overhead (in most cases)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since each task must save the state it needs for later, the memory usage will grow
linearly with the number of callbacks in a chain of computations.</li>
<li>Can be hard to reason about. Many people already know this as &quot;callback hell&quot;.</li>
<li>It's a very different way of writing a program, and will require a substantial
rewrite to go from a &quot;normal&quot; program flow to one that uses a &quot;callback based&quot; flow.</li>
<li>Sharing state between tasks is a hard problem in Rust using this approach due
to its ownership model.</li>
</ul>
<p>An extremely simplified example of a how a callback based approach could look
like is:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn program_main() {
    println!(&quot;So we start the program here!&quot;);
    set_timeout(200, || {
        println!(&quot;We create tasks with a callback that runs once the task finished!&quot;);
    });
    set_timeout(100, || {
        println!(&quot;We can even chain sub-tasks...&quot;);
        set_timeout(50, || {
            println!(&quot;...like this!&quot;);
        })
    });
    println!(&quot;While our tasks are executing we can do other stuff instead of waiting.&quot;);
}

fn main() {
    RT.with(|rt| rt.run(program_main));
}

use std::sync::mpsc::{channel, Receiver, Sender};
use std::{cell::RefCell, collections::HashMap, thread};

thread_local! {
    static RT: Runtime = Runtime::new();
}

struct Runtime {
    callbacks: RefCell&lt;HashMap&lt;usize, Box&lt;dyn FnOnce() -&gt; ()&gt;&gt;&gt;,
    next_id: RefCell&lt;usize&gt;,
    evt_sender: Sender&lt;usize&gt;,
    evt_receiver: Receiver&lt;usize&gt;,
}

fn set_timeout(ms: u64, cb: impl FnOnce() + 'static) {
    RT.with(|rt| {
        let id = *rt.next_id.borrow();
        *rt.next_id.borrow_mut() += 1;
        rt.callbacks.borrow_mut().insert(id, Box::new(cb));
        let evt_sender = rt.evt_sender.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(ms));
            evt_sender.send(id).unwrap();
        });
    });
}

impl Runtime {
    fn new() -&gt; Self {
        let (evt_sender, evt_receiver) = channel();
        Runtime {
            callbacks: RefCell::new(HashMap::new()),
            next_id: RefCell::new(1),
            evt_sender,
            evt_receiver,
        }
    }

    fn run(&amp;self, program: fn()) {
        program();
        for evt_id in &amp;self.evt_receiver {
            let cb = self.callbacks.borrow_mut().remove(&amp;evt_id).unwrap();
            cb();
            if self.callbacks.borrow().is_empty() {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>We're keeping this super simple, and you might wonder what's the difference
between this approach and the one using OS threads and passing in the callbacks
to the OS threads directly.</p>
<p>The difference is that the callbacks are run on the
same thread using this example. The OS threads we create are basically just used
as timers but could represent any kind of resource that we'll have to wait for.</p>
<h2 id="from-callbacks-to-promises"><a class="header" href="#from-callbacks-to-promises">From callbacks to promises</a></h2>
<p>You might start to wonder by now, when are we going to talk about Futures?</p>
<p>Well, we're getting there. You see Promises, Futures, and other names for
deferred computations are often used interchangeably.</p>
<p>There are formal differences between them, but we won't cover those
here. It's worth explaining <code>promises</code> a bit since they're widely known due to
their use in JavaScript. Promises also have a lot in common with Rust's Futures.</p>
<p>First of all, many languages have a concept of promises, but I'll use the one
from JavaScript in the examples below.</p>
<p>Promises are one way to deal with the complexity which comes with a callback
based approach.</p>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js  ignore">setTimer(200, () =&gt; {
  setTimer(100, () =&gt; {
    setTimer(50, () =&gt; {
      console.log(&quot;I'm the last one&quot;);
    });
  });
});
</code></pre>
<p>We can do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js  ignore">function timer(ms) {
    return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

timer(200)
.then(() =&gt; timer(100))
.then(() =&gt; timer(50))
.then(() =&gt; console.log(&quot;I'm the last one&quot;));
</code></pre>
<p>The change is even more substantial under the hood. You see, promises return
a state machine which can be in one of three states: <code>pending</code>, <code>fulfilled</code> or
<code>rejected</code>.</p>
<p>When we call <code>timer(200)</code> in the sample above, we get back a promise in the state <code>pending</code>.</p>
<p>Since promises are re-written as state machines, they also enable an even better
syntax which allows us to write our last example like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js  ignore">async function run() {
    await timer(200);
    await timer(100);
    await timer(50);
    console.log(&quot;I'm the last one&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can consider the <code>run</code> function as a <em>pausable</em> task consisting of several
sub-tasks. On each &quot;await&quot; point it yields control to the scheduler (in this
case it's the well-known JavaScript event loop).</p>
<p>Once one of the sub-tasks changes state to either <code>fulfilled</code> or <code>rejected</code>, the
task is scheduled to continue to the next step.</p>
<p>Syntactically, Rust's Futures 0.1 was a lot like the promises example above, and
Rust's Futures 0.3 is a lot like async/await in our last example.</p>
<p>Now this is also where the similarities between JavaScript promises and Rust's
Futures stop. The reason we go through all this is to get an introduction and
get into the right mindset for exploring Rust's Futures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To avoid confusion later on: There's one difference you should know. JavaScript
promises are <em>eagerly</em> evaluated. That means that once it's created, it starts
running a task. Rust's Futures on the other hand are <em>lazily</em> evaluated. They
need to be polled once before they do any work.</p>

<h2 id="futures"><a class="header" href="#futures">Futures</a></h2>
<p>So what is a future?</p>
<p>A future is a representation of some operation which will complete in the
future.</p>
<p>Async in Rust uses a <code>Poll</code> based approach, in which an asynchronous task will
have three phases.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Poll phase.</strong> A Future is polled which results in the task progressing until
a point where it can no longer make progress. We often refer to the part of the
runtime which polls a Future as an executor.</li>
<li><strong>The Wait phase.</strong> An event source, most often referred to as a reactor,
registers that a Future is waiting for an event to happen and makes sure that it
will wake the Future when that event is ready.</li>
<li><strong>The Wake phase.</strong> The event happens and the Future is woken up. It's now up
to the executor which polled the Future in step 1 to schedule the future to be
polled again and make further progress until it completes or reaches a new point
where it can't make further progress and the cycle repeats.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, when we talk about futures I find it useful to make a distinction between
<strong>non-leaf</strong> futures and <strong>leaf</strong> futures early on because in practice they're
pretty different from one another.</p>
<h3 id="leaf-futures"><a class="header" href="#leaf-futures">Leaf futures</a></h3>
<p>Runtimes create <em>leaf futures</em> which represent a resource like a socket.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore  noplaypen">// stream is a **leaf-future**
let mut stream = tokio::net::TcpStream::connect(&quot;127.0.0.1:3000&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Operations on these resources, like a <code>Read</code> on a socket, will be non-blocking
and return a future which we call a leaf future since it's the future which
we're actually waiting on.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that you'll implement a leaf future yourself unless you're writing
a runtime, but we'll go through how they're constructed in this book as well.</p>
<p>It's also unlikely that you'll pass a leaf-future to a runtime and run it to
completion alone as you'll understand by reading the next paragraph.</p>
<h3 id="non-leaf-futures"><a class="header" href="#non-leaf-futures">Non-leaf-futures</a></h3>
<p>Non-leaf-futures are the kind of futures we as <em>users</em> of a runtime write
ourselves using the <code>async</code> keyword to create a <strong>task</strong> which can be run on the
executor.</p>
<p>The bulk of an async program will consist of non-leaf-futures, which are a kind
of pause-able computation. This is an important distinction since these futures represents a <em>set of operations</em>. Often, such a task will <code>await</code> a leaf future
as one of many operations to complete the task.</p>

<p>The key to these tasks is that they're able to yield control to the runtime's
scheduler and then resume execution again where it left off at a later point.</p>
<p>In contrast to leaf futures, these kind of futures do not themselves represent
an I/O resource. When we poll them they will run until they get to a
leaf-future which returns <code>Pending</code> and then yield control to the scheduler
(which is a part of what we call the runtime).</p>
<h2 id="runtimes"><a class="header" href="#runtimes">Runtimes</a></h2>
<p>Languages like C#, JavaScript, Java, GO, and many others comes with a runtime
for handling concurrency. So if you come from one of those languages this will
seem a bit strange to you.</p>
<p>Rust is different from these languages in the sense that Rust doesn't come with
a runtime for handling concurrency, so you need to use a library which provides
this for you.</p>
<p>Quite a bit of complexity attributed to Futures is actually complexity rooted
in runtimes; creating an efficient runtime is hard.</p>
<p>Learning how to use one correctly requires quite a bit of effort as well, but
you'll see that there are several similarities between these kind of runtimes, so
learning one makes learning the next much easier.</p>
<p>The difference between Rust and other languages is that you have to make an
active choice when it comes to picking a runtime. Most often in other languages,
you'll just use the one provided for you.</p>
<h3 id="a-useful-mental-model-of-an-async-runtime"><a class="header" href="#a-useful-mental-model-of-an-async-runtime">A useful mental model of an async runtime</a></h3>
<p>I find it easier to reason about how Futures work by creating a high level mental model we can use.
To do that I have to introduce the concept of a runtime which will drive our Futures to completion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that the mental model I create here is not the <em>only</em> way to drive Futures to
completion and that Rust’s Futures does not impose any restrictions on how you actually accomplish
this task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A fully working async system in Rust can be divided into three parts:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Reactor</li>
<li>Executor</li>
<li>Future</li>
</ol>
<p>So, how does these three parts work together? They do that through an object called the <code>Waker</code>.
The <code>Waker</code> is how the reactor tells the executor that a specific Future is ready to run. Once you
understand the life cycle and ownership of a Waker, you'll understand how futures work from a user's
perspective. Here is the life cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Waker is created by the <strong>executor.</strong> A common, but not required, method is
to create a new Waker for each Future that is registered with the executor.</li>
<li>When a future is registered with an executor, it’s given a clone of the Waker
object created by the executor. Since this is a shared object (e.g. an
<code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>), all clones actually point to the same underlying object.  Thus,
anything that calls <em>any</em> clone of the original Waker will wake the particular
Future that was registered to it.</li>
<li>The future clones the Waker and passes it to the reactor, which stores it to
use later.</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point in the future, the reactor will decide that the future is ready to run. It will wake
the future via the Waker that it stored. This action will do what is necessary to get the executor
in a position to poll the future.</p>
<p>The Waker object implements everything that we associate with
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/index.html">task</a>. The object is specific to the type of
executor in use, but all Wakers share a similar interface (it's not a trait because
embedded systems can't handle trait objects, but a useful abstraction is to think of it as a trait
object).</p>
<p>Since the interface is the same across all executors, reactors can <em>in theory</em> be completely
oblivious to the type of the executor, and vice-versa. <strong>Executors and reactors never need to
communicate with one another directly.</strong></p>
<p>This design is what gives the futures framework it's power and flexibility and allows the Rust
standard library to provide an ergonomic, zero-cost abstraction for us to use.</p>
<p>In an effort to try to visualize how these parts work together I put together
a set of slides in the next chapter that I hope will help.</p>
<p>The two most popular runtimes for Futures as of writing this is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std">async-std</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">Tokio</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-rusts-standard-library-takes-care-of"><a class="header" href="#what-rusts-standard-library-takes-care-of">What Rust's standard library takes care of</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>A common interface representing an operation which will be completed in the
future through the <code>Future</code> trait.</li>
<li>An ergonomic way of creating tasks which can be suspended and resumed through
the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords.</li>
<li>A defined interface to wake up a suspended task through the <code>Waker</code> type.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's really what Rust's standard library does. As you see there is no definition
of non-blocking I/O, how these tasks are created, or how they're run.</p>
<h2 id="io-vs-cpu-intensive-tasks"><a class="header" href="#io-vs-cpu-intensive-tasks">I/O vs CPU intensive tasks</a></h2>
<p>As you know now, what you normally write are called non-leaf futures. Let's
take a look at this async block using pseudo-rust as example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">let non_leaf = async {
    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(&quot;127.0.0.1:3000&quot;).await.unwrap(); // &lt;-- yield

    // request a large dataset
    let result = stream.write(get_dataset_request).await.unwrap(); // &lt;-- yield

    // wait for the dataset
    let mut response = vec![];
    stream.read(&amp;mut response).await.unwrap(); // &lt;-- yield

    // do some CPU-intensive analysis on the dataset
    let report = analyzer::analyze_data(response).unwrap();

    // send the results back
    stream.write(report).await.unwrap(); // &lt;-- yield
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now, as you'll see when we go through how Futures work, the code we write between
the yield points are run on the same thread as our executor.</p>
<p>That means that while our <code>analyzer</code> is working on the dataset, the executor
is busy doing calculations instead of handling new requests.</p>
<p>Fortunately there are a few ways to handle this, and it's not difficult, but it's
something you must be aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We could create a new leaf future which sends our task to another thread and
resolves when the task is finished. We could <code>await</code> this leaf-future like any
other future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The runtime could have some kind of supervisor that monitors how much time
different tasks take, and move the executor itself to a different thread so it can
continue to run even though our <code>analyzer</code> task is blocking the original executor thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can create a reactor yourself which is compatible with the runtime which
does the analysis any way you see fit, and returns a Future which can be awaited.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, #1 is the usual way of handling this, but some executors implement #2 as well.
The problem with #2 is that if you switch runtime you need to make sure that it
supports this kind of supervision as well or else you will end up blocking the
executor.</p>
<p>#3 is more of theoretical importance, normally you'd be happy by sending the task
to the thread-pool most runtimes provide.</p>
<p>Most executors have a way to accomplish #1 using methods like <code>spawn_blocking</code>.</p>
<p>These methods send the task to a thread-pool created by the runtime where you
can either perform CPU-intensive tasks or &quot;blocking&quot; tasks which are not supported
by the runtime.</p>
<p>Now, armed with this knowledge you are already on a good way for understanding
Futures, but we're not gonna stop yet, there are lots of details to cover.</p>
<p>Take a break or a cup of coffee and get ready as we go for a deep dive in the next chapters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this section we take a deeper look at some  advantages of having a loose
coupling between the Executor-part and Reactor-part of an async runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier in this chapter, I mentioned that it is common for the
executor to create a new Waker for each Future that is registered with the
executor, but that the Waker is a shared object similar to a <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>. One of
the reasons for this design is that it allows different Reactors the
ability to Wake a Future.</p>
<p>As an example of how this can be used, consider how you could create a new type
of Future that has the ability to be canceled:</p>
<p>One way to achieve this would be to add an
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html"><code>AtomicBool</code></a>
to the instance of the future, and an extra method called <code>cancel()</code>.  The
<code>cancel()</code> method  will first set the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html"><code>AtomicBool</code></a>
to signal that the future is now canceled, and then immediately call instance's
own  copy of the Waker.</p>
<p>Once the executor starts executing the Future, the
<em>Future</em> will know that it was canceled, and will do the appropriate cleanup
actions to terminate itself.</p>
<p>The main reason for designing the Future in this manner is because we don't have
to modify either the Executor or the other Reactors; they are all oblivious to
the change.</p>
<p>The only possible issue is with the design of the Future itself; a
Future that is canceled still needs to terminate correctly according to the
rules outlined in the docs for
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>Future</code></a>.  That means
that it can't just delete it's resources and then sit there; it needs to return
a value.  It is up to you to decide if a canceled future will return
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/enum.Poll.html#variant.Pending"><code>Pending</code></a>
forever, or if it will return a value in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/enum.Poll.html#variant.Ready"><code>Ready</code></a>. Just
be aware that if other Futures are <code>await</code>ing it, they won't be able to start
until <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/enum.Poll.html#variant.Ready"><code>Ready</code></a>
is returned.</p>
<p>A common technique for cancelable Futures is to have them return a
Result with an error that signals the Future was canceled; that will permit any
Futures that are awaiting the canceled Future a chance to progress, with the
knowledge that the Future they depended on was canceled.  There are additional
concerns as well, but beyond the scope of this book.  Read the documentation and
code for the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/futures"><code>futures</code></a> crate for a better
understanding of what the concerns are.</p>

<p>The main goal in this part is to build a high level
mental model of how the different pieces we read about in the previous chapter
works together. I hope this will make it easier to understand the high level concepts
before we take a deep dive into topics like trait objects and generators in the next
few chapters.</p>
<p>This is not the only way to create a model of an async system since we're making
assumptions on runtime specifics that can vary a great deal. It's the way I found
it easiest to build upon and it's relevant for understanding a lot of real
implementations you'll find in the async ecosystem.</p>
<p>Finally, please note that the code itself is &quot;pseudo-rust&quot; due to the need for brevity
and clarity.</p>

<p>The <code>Waker</code> type allows for a loose coupling between the reactor-part and the executor-part of a runtime.</p>
<p>By having a wake up mechanism that is <em>not</em> tied to the thing that executes
the future, runtime-implementors can come up with interesting new wake-up
mechanisms. An example of this can be spawning a thread to do some work that
eventually notifies the future, completely independent of the current runtime.</p>
<p>Without a waker, the executor would be the <em>only</em> way to notify a running
task, whereas with the waker, we get a loose coupling where it's easy to
extend the ecosystem with new leaf-level tasks.</p>

object we construct ourselves.</p>

<p>Let's explain this a bit more in detail.</p>
<h2 id="fat-pointers-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#fat-pointers-in-rust">Fat pointers in Rust</a></h2>
<p>To get a better understanding of how we implement the <code>Waker</code> in Rust, we need
to take a step back and talk about some fundamentals. Let's start by taking a
look at the size of some different pointer types in Rust.</p>
<p>Run the following code <em>(You'll have to press &quot;play&quot; to see the output)</em>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use std::mem::size_of;
</span>trait SomeTrait { }

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;======== The size of different pointers in Rust: ========&quot;);
    println!(&quot;&amp;dyn Trait:------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;&amp;dyn SomeTrait&gt;());
    println!(&quot;&amp;[&amp;dyn Trait]:---{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;&amp;[&amp;dyn SomeTrait]&gt;());
    println!(&quot;Box&lt;Trait&gt;:------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;Box&lt;SomeTrait&gt;&gt;());
    println!(&quot;Box&lt;Box&lt;Trait&gt;&gt;:-{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;Box&lt;Box&lt;SomeTrait&gt;&gt;&gt;());
    println!(&quot;&amp;i32:------------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;&amp;i32&gt;());
    println!(&quot;&amp;[i32]:----------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;&amp;[i32]&gt;());
    println!(&quot;Box&lt;i32&gt;:--------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;Box&lt;i32&gt;&gt;());
    println!(&quot;&amp;Box&lt;i32&gt;:-------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;&amp;Box&lt;i32&gt;&gt;());
    println!(&quot;[&amp;dyn Trait;4]:--{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;[&amp;dyn SomeTrait; 4]&gt;());
    println!(&quot;[i32;4]:---------{}&quot;, size_of::&lt;[i32; 4]&gt;());
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>As you see from the output after running this, the sizes of the references varies.
Many are 8 bytes (which is a pointer size on 64 bit systems), but some are 16
bytes.</p>
<p>The 16 byte sized pointers are called &quot;fat pointers&quot; since they carry extra
information.</p>
<p><strong>Example <code>&amp;[i32]</code> :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first 8 bytes is the actual pointer to the first element in the array (or part of an array the slice refers to)</li>
<li>The second 8 bytes is the length of the slice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example <code>&amp;dyn SomeTrait</code>:</strong></p>
<p>This is the type of fat pointer we'll concern ourselves about going forward.
<code>&amp;dyn SomeTrait</code> is a reference to a trait, or what Rust calls a <em>trait object</em>.</p>
<p>The layout for a pointer to a <em>trait object</em> looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 8 bytes points to the <code>data</code> for the trait object</li>
<li>The second 8 bytes points to the <code>vtable</code> for the trait object</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for this is to allow us to refer to an object we know nothing about
except that it implements the methods defined by our trait. To accomplish this
we use <em>dynamic dispatch</em>.</p>
<p>Let's explain this in code instead of words by implementing our own trait
object from these parts:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use std::mem::{align_of, size_of};
</span>// A reference to a trait object is a fat pointer: (data_ptr, vtable_ptr)
trait Test {
    fn add(&amp;self) -&gt; i32;
    fn sub(&amp;self) -&gt; i32;
    fn mul(&amp;self) -&gt; i32;
}

// This will represent our home-brewed fat pointer to a trait object
#[repr(C)]
struct FatPointer&lt;'a&gt; {
    /// A reference is a pointer to an instantiated `Data` instance
    data: &amp;'a mut Data,
    /// Since we need to pass in literal values like length and alignment it's
    /// easiest for us to convert pointers to usize-integers instead of the other way around.
    vtable: *const usize,
}

// This is the data in our trait object. It's just two numbers we want to operate on.
struct Data {
    a: i32,
    b: i32,
}

// ====== function definitions ======
fn add(s: &amp;Data) -&gt; i32 {
    s.a + s.b
}
fn sub(s: &amp;Data) -&gt; i32 {
    s.a - s.b
}
fn mul(s: &amp;Data) -&gt; i32 {
    s.a * s.b
}

fn main() {
    let mut data = Data {a: 3, b: 2};
    // vtable is like special purpose array of pointer-length types with a fixed
    // format where the three first values contains some general information like
    // a pointer to drop and the length and data alignment of `data`.
    let vtable = vec![
        0,                  // pointer to `Drop` (which we're not implementing here)
        size_of::&lt;Data&gt;(),  // length of data
        align_of::&lt;Data&gt;(), // alignment of data

        // we need to make sure we add these in the same order as defined in the Trait.
        add as usize, // function pointer - try changing the order of `add`
        sub as usize, // function pointer - and `sub` to see what happens
        mul as usize, // function pointer
    ];

    let fat_pointer = FatPointer { data: &amp;mut data, vtable: vtable.as_ptr()};
    let test = unsafe { std::mem::transmute::&lt;FatPointer, &amp;dyn Test&gt;(fat_pointer) };

    // And voalá, it's now a trait object we can call methods on
    println!(&quot;Add: 3 + 2 = {}&quot;, test.add());
    println!(&quot;Sub: 3 - 2 = {}&quot;, test.sub());
    println!(&quot;Mul: 3 * 2 = {}&quot;, test.mul());
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Later on, when we implement our own <code>Waker</code> we'll actually set up a <code>vtable</code>
like we do here. The way we create it is slightly different, but now that you know
how regular trait objects work you will probably recognize what we're doing which
makes it much less mysterious.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-section"><a class="header" href="#bonus-section">Bonus section</a></h2>
<p>You might wonder why the <code>Waker</code> was implemented like this and not just as a
normal trait?</p>
<p>The reason is flexibility. Implementing the Waker the way we do here gives a lot
of flexibility of choosing what memory management scheme to use.</p>
<p>The &quot;normal&quot; way is by using an <code>Arc</code> to use reference count keep track of when
a Waker object can be dropped. However, this is not the only way, you could also
use purely global functions and state, or any other way you wish.</p>
<p>This leaves a lot of options on the table for runtime implementors.</p>

<p>The motivation for <code>Generator</code>s can be found in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2033-experimental-coroutines.md">RFC#2033</a>. It's very
well written and I can recommend reading through it (it talks as much about
async/await as it does about generators).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-learn-about-generators"><a class="header" href="#why-learn-about-generators">Why learn about generators?</a></h2>
<p>Generators/yield and async/await are so similar that once you understand one
you should be able to understand the other.</p>
<p>It's much easier for me to provide runnable and short examples using Generators
instead of Futures which require us to introduce a lot of concepts now that
we'll cover later just to show an example.</p>
<p>Async/await works like generators but instead of returning a generator it returns
a special object implementing the Future trait.</p>
<p>A small bonus is that you'll have a pretty good introduction to both Generators
and Async/Await by the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>Basically, there were three main options discussed when designing how Rust would
handle concurrency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stackful coroutines, better known as green threads.</li>
<li>Using combinators.</li>
<li>Stackless coroutines, better known as generators.</li>
</ol>
<p>We covered <a href="0_background_information.html#green-threads">green threads in the background information</a>
so we won't repeat that here. We'll concentrate on the variants of stackless
coroutines which Rust uses today.</p>
<h3 id="combinators"><a class="header" href="#combinators">Combinators</a></h3>
<p><code>Futures 0.1</code> used combinators. If you've worked with Promises in JavaScript,
you already know combinators. In Rust they look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen ignore">let future = Connection::connect(conn_str).and_then(|conn| {
    conn.query(&quot;somerequest&quot;).map(|row|{
        SomeStruct::from(row)
    }).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;SomeStruct&gt;&gt;()
});

let rows: Result&lt;Vec&lt;SomeStruct&gt;, SomeLibraryError&gt; = block_on(future);

</code></pre>
<p><strong>There are mainly three downsides I'll focus on using this technique:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The error messages produced could be extremely long and arcane</li>
<li>Not optimal memory usage</li>
<li>Did not allow borrowing across combinator steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point #3, is actually a major drawback with <code>Futures 0.1</code>.</p>
<p>Not allowing borrows across suspension points ends up being very
un-ergonomic and to accomplish some tasks it requires extra allocations or
copying which is inefficient.</p>
<p>The reason for the higher than optimal memory usage is that this is basically
a callback-based approach, where each closure stores all the data it needs
for computation. This means that as we chain these, the memory required to store
the needed state increases with each added step.</p>
<h3 id="stackless-coroutinesgenerators"><a class="header" href="#stackless-coroutinesgenerators">Stackless coroutines/generators</a></h3>
<p>This is the model used in Rust today. It has a few notable advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's easy to convert normal Rust code to a stackless coroutine using using
async/await as keywords (it can even be done using a macro).</li>
<li>No need for context switching and saving/restoring CPU state</li>
<li>No need to handle dynamic stack allocation</li>
<li>Very memory efficient</li>
<li>Allows us to borrow across suspension points</li>
</ol>
<p>The last point is in contrast to <code>Futures 0.1</code>. With async/await we can do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">async fn myfn() {
    let text = String::from(&quot;Hello world&quot;);
    let borrowed = &amp;text[0..5];
    somefuture.await;
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, borrowed);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Async in Rust is implemented using Generators. So to understand how async really
works we need to understand generators first. Generators in Rust are implemented
as state machines.</p>
<p>The memory footprint of a chain of computations is defined by <em>the largest footprint
that a single step requires</em>.</p>
<p>That means that adding steps to a chain of computations might not require any
increased memory at all and it's one of the reasons why Futures and Async in
Rust has very little overhead.</p>
<h2 id="how-generators-work"><a class="header" href="#how-generators-work">How generators work</a></h2>
<p>In Nightly Rust today you can use the <code>yield</code> keyword. Basically using this
keyword in a closure, converts it to a generator. A closure could look like this
before we had a concept of <code>Pin</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen ignore">#![feature(generators, generator_trait)]
use std::ops::{Generator, GeneratorState};

fn main() {
    let a: i32 = 4;
    let mut gen = move || {
        println!(&quot;Hello&quot;);
        yield a * 2;
        println!(&quot;world!&quot;);
    };

    if let GeneratorState::Yielded(n) = gen.resume() {
        println!(&quot;Got value {}&quot;, n);
    }

    if let GeneratorState::Complete(()) = gen.resume() {
        ()
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>Early on, before there was a consensus about the design of <code>Pin</code>, this
compiled to something looking similar to this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut gen = GeneratorA::start(4);

    if let GeneratorState::Yielded(n) = gen.resume() {
        println!(&quot;Got value {}&quot;, n);
    }

    if let GeneratorState::Complete(()) = gen.resume() {
        ()
    };
}

// If you've ever wondered why the parameters are called Y and R the naming from
// the original rfc most likely holds the answer
enum GeneratorState&lt;Y, R&gt; {
    Yielded(Y),  // originally called `Yield(Y)`
    Complete(R), // originally called `Return(R)`
}

trait Generator {
    type Yield;
    type Return;
    fn resume(&amp;mut self) -&gt; GeneratorState&lt;Self::Yield, Self::Return&gt;;
}

enum GeneratorA {
    Enter(i32),
    Yield1(i32),
    Exit,
}

impl GeneratorA {
    fn start(a1: i32) -&gt; Self {
        GeneratorA::Enter(a1)
    }
}

impl Generator for GeneratorA {
    type Yield = i32;
    type Return = ();
    fn resume(&amp;mut self) -&gt; GeneratorState&lt;Self::Yield, Self::Return&gt; {
        // lets us get ownership over current state
        match std::mem::replace(self, GeneratorA::Exit) {
            GeneratorA::Enter(a1) =&gt; {

          /*----code before yield----*/
                println!(&quot;Hello&quot;);
                let a = a1 * 2;

                *self = GeneratorA::Yield1(a);
                GeneratorState::Yielded(a)
            }

            GeneratorA::Yield1(_) =&gt; {
          /*-----code after yield-----*/
                println!(&quot;world!&quot;);

                *self = GeneratorA::Exit;
                GeneratorState::Complete(())
            }
            GeneratorA::Exit =&gt; panic!(&quot;Can't advance an exited generator!&quot;),
        }
    }
}

</code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>yield</code> keyword was discussed first in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1823">RFC#1823</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1832">RFC#1832</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that you know that the <code>yield</code> keyword in reality rewrites your code to become a state machine,
you'll also know the basics of how <code>await</code> works. It's very similar.</p>
<p>Now, there are some limitations in our naive state machine above. What happens when you have a
<code>borrow</code> across a <code>yield</code> point?</p>
<p>We could forbid that, but <strong>one of the major design goals for the async/await syntax has been
to allow this</strong>. These kinds of borrows were not possible using <code>Futures 0.1</code> so we can't let this
limitation just slip and call it a day yet.</p>
<p>Instead of discussing it in theory, let's look at some code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We'll use the optimized version of the state machines which is used in Rust today. For a more
in depth explanation see <a href="https://tmandry.gitlab.io/blog/posts/optimizing-await-1/">Tyler Mandry's excellent article: How Rust optimizes async/await</a></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen ignore">let mut generator = move || {
        let to_borrow = String::from(&quot;Hello&quot;);
        let borrowed = &amp;to_borrow;
        yield borrowed.len();
        println!(&quot;{} world!&quot;, borrowed);
    };
</code></pre>
<p>We'll be hand-coding some versions of a state-machines representing a state
machine for the generator defined above.</p>
<p>We step through each step &quot;manually&quot; in every example, so it looks pretty
unfamiliar. We could add some syntactic sugar like implementing the <code>Iterator</code>
trait for our generators which would let us do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">while let Some(val) = generator.next() {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, val);
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's a pretty trivial change to make, but this chapter is already getting long.
Just keep this in the back of your head as we move forward.</p>
<p>Now what does our rewritten state machine look like with this example?</p>

<p>If you try to compile this you'll get an error (just try it yourself by pressing play).</p>
<p>What is the lifetime of <code>&amp;String</code>. It's not the same as the lifetime of <code>Self</code>. It's not <code>static</code>.
Turns out that it's not possible for us in Rust's syntax to describe this lifetime, which means, that
to make this work, we'll have to let the compiler know that <em>we</em> control this correctly ourselves.</p>
<p>That means turning to unsafe.</p>
<p>Let's try to write an implementation that will compile using <code>unsafe</code>. As you'll
see we end up in a <em>self-referential struct</em>. A struct which holds references
into itself.</p>
<p>As you'll notice, this compiles just fine!</p>

<p>Wait? What happened to &quot;Hello&quot;? And why did our code segfault?</p>
<p>Turns out that while the example above compiles just fine, we expose consumers
of this this API to both possible undefined behavior and other memory errors
while using just safe Rust. This is a big problem!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've actually forced the code above to use the nightly version of the compiler.
If you run <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=5cbe9897c0e23a502afd2740c7e78b98">the example above on the playground</a>,
you'll see that it runs without panicking on the current stable (1.42.0) but
panics on the current nightly (1.44.0). Scary!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll explain exactly what happened here using a slightly simpler example in the next
chapter and we'll fix our generator using <code>Pin</code> so don't worry, you'll see exactly
what goes wrong and see how <code>Pin</code> can help us deal with self-referential types safely in a
second.</p>
<p>Before we go and explain the problem in detail, let's finish off this chapter
by looking at how generators and the async keyword is related.</p>
<h2 id="async-and-generators"><a class="header" href="#async-and-generators">Async and generators</a></h2>
<p>Futures in Rust are implemented as state machines much the same way Generators
are state machines.</p>
<p>You might have noticed the similarities in the syntax used in async blocks and
the syntax used in generators:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">let mut gen = move || {
        let to_borrow = String::from(&quot;Hello&quot;);
        let borrowed = &amp;to_borrow;
        yield borrowed.len();
        println!(&quot;{} world!&quot;, borrowed);
    };
</code></pre>
<p>Compare that with a similar example using async blocks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">let mut fut = async {
        let to_borrow = String::from(&quot;Hello&quot;);
        let borrowed = &amp;to_borrow;
        SomeResource::some_task().await;
        println!(&quot;{} world!&quot;, borrowed);
    };
</code></pre>
<p>The difference is that Futures have different states than what a <code>Generator</code> would
have.</p>
<p>An async block will return a <code>Future</code> instead of a <code>Generator</code>, however, the way
a Future works and the way a Generator work internally is similar.</p>
<p>Instead of calling <code>Generator::resume</code> we call <code>Future::poll</code>, and instead of
returning <code>Yielded</code> or <code>Complete</code> it returns <code>Pending</code> or <code>Ready</code>. Each <code>await</code>
point in a future is like a <code>yield</code> point in a generator.</p>
<p>Do you see how they're connected now?</p>
<p>Thats why knowing how generators work and the challenges they pose also teaches
you how futures work and the challenges we need to tackle when working with them.</p>
<p>The same goes for the challenges of borrowing across yield/await points.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/45337/files">PR#45337</a> you can actually run code like the one in our
example in Rust today using the <code>static</code> keyword on nightly. Try it for
yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beware that the API is changing rapidly. As I was writing this book, generators
had an API change adding support for a &quot;resume&quot; argument to get passed into the
generator closure.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Let's jump straight to it. Pinning is one of those subjects which is hard to wrap
your head around in the start, but once you unlock a mental model for it
it gets significantly easier to reason about.</p>
<h2 id="definitions"><a class="header" href="#definitions">Definitions</a></h2>
<p>Pin wraps a pointer. A reference to an object is a pointer. Pin gives some
guarantees about the <em>pointee</em> (the data it points to) which we'll explore further
in this chapter.</p>
<p>Pin consists of the <code>Pin</code> type and the <code>Unpin</code> marker. Pin's purpose in life is
to govern the rules that need to apply for types which implement <code>!Unpin</code>.</p>
<p>Yep, you're right, that's double negation right there. <code>!Unpin</code> means
&quot;not-un-pin&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This naming scheme is one of Rust's safety features where it deliberately
tests if you're too tired to safely implement a type with this marker. If
you're starting to get confused, or even angry, by <code>!Unpin</code> it's a good sign
that it's time to lay down the work and start over tomorrow with a fresh mind.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a more serious note, I feel obliged to mention that there are valid reasons
for the names that were chosen. Naming is not easy, and I considered renaming
<code>Unpin</code> and <code>!Unpin</code> in this book to make them easier to reason about.</p>
<p>However, an experienced member of the Rust community convinced me that that there
are just too many nuances and edge-cases to consider which are easily overlooked when
naively giving these markers different names, and I'm convinced that we'll
just have to get used to them and use them as is.</p>
<p>If you want to you can read a bit of the discussion from the
<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/naming-pin-anchor-move/6864/12">internals thread</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pinning-and-self-referential-structs"><a class="header" href="#pinning-and-self-referential-structs">Pinning and self-referential structs</a></h2>
<p>Let's start where we left off in the last chapter by making the problem we
saw using a self-references in our generator a lot simpler by making
some self-referential structs that are easier to reason about than our
state machines:</p>
<p>For now our example will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">use std::pin::Pin;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Test {
    a: String,
    b: *const String,
}

impl Test {
    fn new(txt: &amp;str) -&gt; Self {
        Test {
            a: String::from(txt),
            b: std::ptr::null(),
        }
    }

    fn init(&amp;mut self) {
        let self_ref: *const String = &amp;self.a;
        self.b = self_ref;
    }

    fn a(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {
        &amp;self.a
    }

    fn b(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;String {
        unsafe {&amp;*(self.b)}
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's walk through this example since we'll be using it the rest of this chapter.</p>
<p>We have a self-referential struct <code>Test</code>. <code>Test</code> needs an <code>init</code> method to be
created which is strange but we'll need that to keep this example as short as
possible.</p>
<p><code>Test</code> provides two methods to get a reference to the value of the fields
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Since <code>b</code> is a reference to <code>a</code> we store it as a pointer since
the borrowing rules of Rust doesn't allow us to define this lifetime.</p>
<p>Now, let's use this example to explain the problem we encounter in detail. As
you see, this works as expected:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut test1 = Test::new(&quot;test1&quot;);
    test1.init();
    let mut test2 = Test::new(&quot;test2&quot;);
    test2.init();

    println!(&quot;a: {}, b: {}&quot;, test1.a(), test1.b());
    println!(&quot;a: {}, b: {}&quot;, test2.a(), test2.b());

<p>Naively, we could think that what we should get a debug print of <code>test1</code> two
times like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">a: test1, b: test1
a: test1, b: test1
</code></pre>
<p>But instead we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">a: test1, b: test1
a: test1, b: test2
</code></pre>
<p>The pointer to <code>test2.b</code> still points to the old location which is inside <code>test1</code>
now. The struct is not self-referential anymore, it holds a pointer to a field
in a different object. That means we can't rely on the lifetime of <code>test2.b</code> to
be tied to the lifetime of <code>test2</code> anymore.</p>
<p>If you're still not convinced, this should at least convince you:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut test1 = Test::new(&quot;test1&quot;);
    test1.init();
    let mut test2 = Test::new(&quot;test2&quot;);

    println!(&quot;a: {}, b: {}&quot;, test1.a(), test1.b());

<p>That shouldn't happen. There is no serious error yet, but as you can imagine
it's easy to create serious bugs using this code.</p>
<p>I created a diagram to help visualize what's going on:</p>
<p><strong>Fig 2: Before and after swap</strong>
<img src="./assets/swap_problem.jpg" alt="swap_problem" /></p>
<p>As you can see this results in unwanted behavior. It's easy to get this to
segfault, show UB and fail in other spectacular ways as well.</p>
<h2 id="pinning-to-the-stack"><a class="header" href="#pinning-to-the-stack">Pinning to the stack</a></h2>
<p>Now, we can solve this problem by using <code>Pin</code> instead. Let's take a look at what
our example would look like then:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">use std::pin::Pin;
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Test {
    a: String,
    b: *const String,
    _marker: PhantomPinned,
}


impl Test {
    fn new(txt: &amp;str) -&gt; Self {
        Test {
            a: String::from(txt),
            b: std::ptr::null(),
            _marker: PhantomPinned, // This makes our type `!Unpin`
        }
    }
    fn init&lt;'a&gt;(self: Pin&lt;&amp;'a mut Self&gt;) {
        let self_ptr: *const String = &amp;self.a;
        let this = unsafe { self.get_unchecked_mut() };
        this.b = self_ptr;
    }

    fn a&lt;'a&gt;(self: Pin&lt;&amp;'a Self&gt;) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
        &amp;self.get_ref().a
    }

    fn b&lt;'a&gt;(self: Pin&lt;&amp;'a Self&gt;) -&gt; &amp;'a String {
        unsafe { &amp;*(self.b) }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, what we've done here is pinning an object to the stack. That will always be
<code>unsafe</code> if our type implements <code>!Unpin</code>.</p>
<p>We use the same tricks here, including requiring an <code>init</code>. If we want to fix that
and let users avoid <code>unsafe</code> we need to pin our data on the heap instead which
we'll show in a second.</p>
<p>Let's see what happens if we run our example now:</p>

<p>As you see from the error you get by running the code the type system prevents
us from swapping the pinned pointers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's important to note that stack pinning will always depend on the current
stack frame we're in, so we can't create a self referential object in one
stack frame and return it since any pointers we take to &quot;self&quot; are invalidated.</p>
<p>It also puts a lot of responsibility in your hands if you pin an object to the
stack. A mistake that is easy to make is, forgetting to shadow the original variable
since you could drop the <code>Pin</code> and access the old value after it's initialized
like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
   let mut test1 = Test::new(&quot;test1&quot;);
   let mut test1_pin = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&amp;mut test1) };
   Test::init(test1_pin.as_mut());
   drop(test1_pin);

   let mut test2 = Test::new(&quot;test2&quot;);
   mem::swap(&amp;mut test1, &amp;mut test2);
   println!(&quot;Not self referential anymore: {:?}&quot;, test1.b);

<p>For completeness let's remove some unsafe and the need for an <code>init</code> method
at the cost of a heap allocation. Pinning to the heap is safe so the user
doesn't need to implement any unsafe code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  edition2018">use std::pin::Pin;

<p>The fact that it's safe to pin heap allocated data even if it is <code>!Unpin</code>
makes sense. Once the data is allocated on the heap it will have a stable address.</p>
<p>There is no need for us as users of the API to take special care and ensure
that the self-referential pointer stays valid.</p>
<p>There are ways to safely give some guarantees on stack pinning as well, but right
now you need to use a crate like <a href="https://docs.rs/pin-project/">pin_project</a> to do that.</p>
<h2 id="practical-rules-for-pinning"><a class="header" href="#practical-rules-for-pinning">Practical rules for Pinning</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If <code>T: Unpin</code> (which is the default), then <code>Pin&lt;'a, T&gt;</code> is entirely
equivalent to <code>&amp;'a mut T</code>. in other words: <code>Unpin</code> means it's OK for this type
to be moved even when pinned, so <code>Pin</code> will have no effect on such a type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting a <code>&amp;mut T</code> to a pinned T requires unsafe if <code>T: !Unpin</code>. In
other words: requiring a pinned pointer to a type which is <code>!Unpin</code> prevents
the <em>user</em> of that API from moving that value unless they choose to write <code>unsafe</code>
code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pinning does nothing special with memory allocation like putting it into some
&quot;read only&quot; memory or anything fancy. It only uses the type system to prevent
certain operations on this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most standard library types implement <code>Unpin</code>. The same goes for most
&quot;normal&quot; types you encounter in Rust. <code>Future</code>s and <code>Generator</code>s are two
exceptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main use case for <code>Pin</code> is to allow self referential types, the whole
justification for stabilizing them was to allow that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implementation behind objects that are <code>!Unpin</code> is most likely unsafe.
Moving such a type after it has been pinned can cause the universe to crash. As of the time of writing
this book, creating and reading fields of a self referential struct still requires <code>unsafe</code>
(the only way to do it is to create a struct containing raw pointers to itself).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can add a <code>!Unpin</code> bound on a type on nightly with a feature flag, or
by adding <code>std::marker::PhantomPinned</code> to your type on stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can either pin an object to the stack or to the heap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pinning a <code>!Unpin</code> object to the stack requires <code>unsafe</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pinning a <code>!Unpin</code> object to the heap does not require <code>unsafe</code>. There is a shortcut for doing this using <code>Box::pin</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Unsafe code does not mean it's literally &quot;unsafe&quot;, it only relieves the
guarantees you normally get from the compiler. An <code>unsafe</code> implementation can
be perfectly safe to do, but you have no safety net.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="projectionstructural-pinning"><a class="header" href="#projectionstructural-pinning">Projection/structural pinning</a></h3>
<p>In short, projection is a programming language term. <code>mystruct.field1</code> is a
projection. Structural pinning is using <code>Pin</code> on fields. This has several
caveats and is not something you'll normally see so I refer to the documentation
for that.</p>
<h3 id="pin-and-drop"><a class="header" href="#pin-and-drop">Pin and Drop</a></h3>
<p>The <code>Pin</code> guarantee exists from the moment the value is pinned until it's dropped.
In the <code>Drop</code> implementation you take a mutable reference to <code>self</code>, which means
extra care must be taken when implementing <code>Drop</code> for pinned types.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together"><a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</a></h2>
<p>This is exactly what we'll do when we implement our own <code>Future</code>, so stay tuned,
we're soon finished.</p>

<p>But now, let's prevent this problem using <code>Pin</code>. I've commented along the way to
make it easier to spot and understand the changes we need to make.</p>

<p>Now, as you see, the consumer of this API must either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Box the value and thereby allocating it on the heap</li>
<li>Use <code>unsafe</code> and pin the value to the stack. The user knows that if they move
the value afterwards it will violate the guarantee they promise to uphold when
they did their unsafe implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, after this you'll have an idea of what happens when you use the
<code>yield</code> or <code>await</code> keywords inside an async function, and why we need <code>Pin</code> if
we want to be able to safely borrow across <code>yield/await</code> points.</p>

<p>We'll create our own Futures together with a fake reactor and a simple

<p>Let's start off by getting all our imports right away so you can follow along</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplaypen  ignore">use std::{

</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-executor"><a class="header" href="#the-executor">The Executor</a></h2>
<p>The executors responsibility is to take one or more futures and run them to completion.</p>
<p>The first thing an <code>executor</code> does when it gets a <code>Future</code> is polling it.</p>
<p><strong>When polled one of three things can happen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The future returns <code>Ready</code> and we schedule whatever chained operations to run</li>
<li>The future hasn't been polled before so we pass it a <code>Waker</code> and suspend it</li>
<li>The futures has been polled before but is not ready and returns <code>Pending</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Rust provides a way for the Reactor and Executor to communicate through the <code>Waker</code>. The reactor stores this <code>Waker</code> and calls <code>Waker::wake()</code> on it once
a <code>Future</code> has resolved and should be polled again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that this chapter has a bonus section called <a href="./6_future_example.html#bonus-section---a-proper-way-to-park-our-thread">A  Proper Way to Park our Thread</a> which shows how to avoid <code>thread::park</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our Executor will look like this:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplaypen  ignore">// Our executor takes any object which implements the `Future` trait
fn block_on&lt;F: Future&gt;(mut future: F) -&gt; F::Output {

    // the first thing we do is to construct a `Waker` which we'll pass on to
    // the `reactor` so it can wake us up when an event is ready.
    let mywaker = Arc::new(MyWaker{ thread: thread::current() });
    let waker = waker_into_waker(Arc::into_raw(mywaker));

    // The context struct is just a wrapper for a `Waker` object. Maybe in the
    // future this will do more, but right now it's just a wrapper.
    let mut cx = Context::from_waker(&amp;waker);

    // So, since we run this on one thread and run one future to completion
    // we can pin the `Future` to the stack. This is unsafe, but saves an
    // allocation. We could `Box::pin` it too if we wanted. This is however
    // safe since we shadow `future` so it can't be accessed again and will
    // not move until it's dropped.
    let mut future = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&amp;mut future) };

    // We poll in a loop, but it's not a busy loop. It will only run when
    // an event occurs, or a thread has a &quot;spurious wakeup&quot; (an unexpected wakeup
    // that can happen for no good reason).
    let val = loop {
        match Future::poll(future.as_mut(), &amp;mut cx) {

            // when the Future is ready we're finished

        };

    val
}
</code></pre>
<p>In all the examples you'll see in this chapter I've chosen to comment the code
extensively. I find it easier to follow along that way so I'll not repeat myself
here and focus only on some important aspects that might need further explanation.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that simply calling <code>thread::sleep</code> as we do here can lead to
both deadlocks and errors. We'll explain a bit more later and fix this if you
read all the way to the <a href="./6_future_example.html##bonus-section---a-proper-way-to-park-our-thread">Bonus Section</a> at
the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>For now, we keep it as simple and easy to understand as we can by just going
to sleep.</p>
<p>Now that you've read so much about <code>Generator</code>s and <code>Pin</code> already this should
be rather easy to understand. <code>Future</code> is a state machine, every <code>await</code> point
is a <code>yield</code> point. We could borrow data across <code>await</code> points and we meet the
exact same challenges as we do when borrowing across <code>yield</code> points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Context</code> is just a wrapper around the <code>Waker</code>. At the time of writing this
book it's nothing more. In the future it might be possible that the <code>Context</code>
object will do more than just wrapping a <code>Future</code> so having this extra
abstraction gives some flexibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As explained in the <a href="./3_generators_pin.html">chapter about generators</a>, we use
<code>Pin</code> and the guarantees that give us to allow <code>Future</code>s to have self
references.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-implementation"><a class="header" href="#the-future-implementation">The <code>Future</code> implementation</a></h2>
<p>Futures has a well defined interface, which means they can be used across the
entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>We can chain these <code>Future</code>s so that once a <strong>leaf-future</strong> is
ready we'll perform a set of operations until either the task is finished or we
reach yet another <strong>leaf-future</strong> which we'll wait for and yield control to the
scheduler.</p>
<p><strong>Our Future implementation looks like this:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  noplaypen  ignore">// This is the definition of our `Waker`. We use a regular thread-handle here.

</code></pre>
<p>This is mostly pretty straight forward. The confusing part is the strange way
we need to construct the <code>Waker</code>, but since we've already created our own
<em>trait objects</em> from raw parts, this looks pretty familiar. Actually, it's
even a bit easier.</p>
<p>We use an <code>Arc</code> here to pass out a ref-counted borrow of our <code>MyWaker</code>. This
is pretty normal, and makes this easy and safe to work with. Cloning a <code>Waker</code>
is just increasing the refcount in this case.</p>
<p>Dropping a <code>Waker</code> is as easy as decreasing the refcount. Now, in special
cases we could choose to not use an <code>Arc</code>. So this low-level method is there
to allow such cases.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we only used <code>Arc</code> there is no reason for us to go through all the
trouble of creating our own <code>vtable</code> and a <code>RawWaker</code>. We could just implement
a normal trait.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the future this will probably be possible in the standard
library as well. For now, <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/0.3.0-alpha.13/futures/task/trait.ArcWake.html">this trait lives in the nursery</a>, but my
guess is that this will be a part of the standard library after some maturing.</p>
<p>We choose to pass in a reference to the whole <code>Reactor</code> here. This isn't normal.
The reactor will often be a global resource which let's us register interests
without passing around a reference.</p>

<h2 id="the-reactor"><a class="header" href="#the-reactor">The Reactor</a></h2>
<p>This is the home stretch, and not strictly <code>Future</code> related, but we need one
to have an example to run.</p>
<p>Since concurrency mostly makes sense when interacting with the outside world (or
at least some peripheral), we need something to actually abstract over this
interaction in an asynchronous way.</p>
<p>This is the Reactors job. Most often you'll see reactors in Rust use a library
called <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio">Mio</a>, which provides non blocking APIs and event notification for
several platforms.</p>
<p>The reactor will typically give you something like a <code>TcpStream</code> (or any other
resource) which you'll use to create an I/O request. What you get in return is a
<code>Future</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If our reactor did some real I/O work our <code>Task</code> in would instead be represent
a non-blocking <code>TcpStream</code> which registers interest with the global <code>Reactor</code>.
Passing around a reference to the Reactor itself is pretty uncommon but I find
it makes reasoning about what's happening easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our example task is a timer that only spawns a thread and puts it to sleep for
the number of seconds we specify. The reactor we create here will create a
<strong>leaf-future</strong> representing each timer. In return the Reactor receives a waker
which it will call once the task is finished.</p>
<p>To be able to run the code here in the browser there is not much real I/O we
can do so just pretend that this is actually represents some useful I/O operation
for the sake of this example.</p>
<p><strong>Our Reactor will look like this:</strong></p>

<p>I added a some debug printouts so we can observe a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>How the <code>Waker</code> object looks just like the <em>trait object</em> we talked about in an earlier chapter</li>
<li>The program flow from start to finish</li>
</ol>
<p>The last point is relevant when we move on the the last paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one subtle thing to note about our example. What happens if we pass
in the same <code>id</code> for both events?</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">let future1 = Task::new(reactor.clone(), 1, 1);
let future2 = Task::new(reactor.clone(), 2, 1);
</code></pre>
<p>We'll discuss this a bit more under exercises in the last chapter where we
also look at ways to fix it. For now, just make a note of it so you're aware
of the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="asyncawait-and-concurrency"><a class="header" href="#asyncawait-and-concurrency">Async/Await and concurrency</a></h2>
<p>The <code>async</code> keyword can be used on functions as in <code>async fn(...)</code> or on a
block as in <code>async { ... }</code>. Both will turn your function, or block, into a
<code>Future</code>.</p>
<p>These Futures are rather simple. Imagine our generator from a few chapters
back. Every <code>await</code> point is like a <code>yield</code> point.</p>
<p>Instead of <code>yielding</code> a value we pass in, we yield the result of calling <code>poll</code> on
the next <code>Future</code> we're awaiting.</p>
<p>Our <code>mainfut</code> contains two non-leaf futures which it will call <code>poll</code> on. <strong>Non-leaf-futures</strong>
has a <code>poll</code> method that simply polls their inner futures and these state machines
are polled until some &quot;leaf future&quot; in the end either returns <code>Ready</code> or <code>Pending</code>.</p>
<p>The way our example is right now, it's not much better than regular synchronous
code. For us to actually await multiple futures at the same time we somehow need
to <code>spawn</code> them so the executor starts running them concurrently.</p>
<p>Our example as it stands now returns this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">Future got 1 at time: 1.00.
Future got 2 at time: 3.00.
</code></pre>
<p>If these Futures were executed asynchronously we would expect to see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">Future got 1 at time: 1.00.
Future got 2 at time: 2.00.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this doesn't mean they need to run in parallel. They <em>can</em> run in
parallel but there is no requirement. Remember that we're waiting for some
external resource so we can fire off many such calls on a single thread and
handle each event as it resolves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this is the point where I'll refer you to some better resources for
implementing a better executor. You should have a pretty good understanding of
the concept of Futures by now helping you along the way.</p>
<p>The next step should be getting to know how more advanced runtimes work and
how they implement different ways of running Futures to completion.</p>
<p><a href="./conclusion.html#building-a-better-exectuor">If I were you I would read this next, and try to implement it for our example.</a>.</p>
<p>That's actually it for now. There as probably much more to learn, this is enough
for today.</p>
<p>I hope exploring Futures and async in general gets easier after this read and I
do really hope that you do continue to explore further.</p>
<p>Don't forget the exercises in the last chapter 😊.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-section---a-proper-way-to-park-our-thread"><a class="header" href="#bonus-section---a-proper-way-to-park-our-thread">Bonus Section - a Proper Way to Park our Thread</a></h2>
<p>As we explained earlier in our chapter, simply calling <code>thread::sleep</code> is not really
sufficient to implement a proper reactor. You can also reach a tool like the <code>Parker</code>
in crossbeam: <a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.7.3/crossbeam/sync/struct.Parker.html">crossbeam::sync::Parker</a></p>
<p>Since it doesn't require many lines of code to create a working solution ourselves we'll show how
we can solve that by using a <code>Condvar</code> and a <code>Mutex</code> instead.</p>
<p>Start by implementing our own <code>Parker</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">#[derive(Default)]
struct Parker(Mutex&lt;bool&gt;, Condvar);

impl Parker {
    fn park(&amp;self) {

        // We aquire a lock to the Mutex which protects our flag indicating if we
        // should resume execution or not.
        let mut resumable = self.0.lock().unwrap();

            // We put this in a loop since there is a chance we'll get woken, but
            // our flag hasn't changed. If that happens, we simply go back to sleep.
            while !*resumable {

                // We sleep until someone notifies us
                resumable = self.1.wait(resumable).unwrap();
            }

        // We immidiately set the condition to false, so that next time we call `park` we'll
        // go right to sleep.
        *resumable = false;
    }

    fn unpark(&amp;self) {
        // We simply acquire a lock to our flag and sets the condition to `runnable` when we
        // get it.
        *self.0.lock().unwrap() = true;

        // We notify our `Condvar` so it wakes up and resumes.
        self.1.notify_one();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Condvar</code> in Rust is designed to work together with a Mutex. Usually, you'd think that we don't
release the mutex-lock we acquire in <code>self.0.lock().unwrap();</code> before we go to sleep. Which means
that our <code>unpark</code> function never will acquire a lock to our flag and we deadlock.</p>
<p>Using <code>Condvar</code> we avoid this since the <code>Condvar</code> will consume our lock so it's released at the
moment we go to sleep.</p>
<p>When we resume again, our <code>Condvar</code> returns our lock so we can continue to operate on it.</p>
<p>This means we need to make some very slight changes to our executor like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">fn block_on&lt;F: Future&gt;(mut future: F) -&gt; F::Output {
    let parker = Arc::new(Parker::default()); // &lt;--- NB!
    let mywaker = Arc::new(MyWaker { parker: parker.clone() }); &lt;--- NB!
    let waker = mywaker_into_waker(Arc::into_raw(mywaker));
    let mut cx = Context::from_waker(&amp;waker);

    // SAFETY: we shadow `future` so it can't be accessed again.
    let mut future = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&amp;mut future) };
    loop {
        match Future::poll(future.as_mut(), &amp;mut cx) {
            Poll::Ready(val) =&gt; break val,
            Poll::Pending =&gt; parker.park(), // &lt;--- NB!
        };
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And we need to change our <code>Waker</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">#[derive(Clone)]
struct MyWaker {
    parker: Arc&lt;Parker&gt;,
}

fn mywaker_wake(s: &amp;MyWaker) {
    let waker_arc = unsafe { Arc::from_raw(s) };
    waker_arc.parker.unpark();
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that's really all there is to it.</p>

<p>The comments delimiting the Executor, <code>Future</code> implementation and Reactor, 
emphasize on what is part of the language (Future and Waker) and what is not (runtime specifics). 
Therefore, the comments associate the <code>Waker</code> with the <code>Future</code> implementation,
despite its strong relation with the Executor.</p>

<p>So our implementation has taken some obvious shortcuts and could use some improvement.
Actually digging into the code and try things yourself is a good way to learn. Here are

<p>First of all, protecting the whole <code>Reactor</code> and passing it around is overkill. We're only
interested in synchronizing some parts of the information it contains. Try to refactor that
out and only synchronize access to what's really needed.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to have a look at how async_std solves this with a global <a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/blob/b446cd023084a157b8a531cff65b8df37750be58/src/rt/mod.rs#L15-L23">runtime</a> which includes the <a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/blob/b446cd023084a157b8a531cff65b8df37750be58/src/rt/runtime.rs#L39-L70">reactor</a>

<p>Right now, we can only run one and one future only. Most runtimes has a <code>spawn</code>
function which let's you start off a future and <code>await</code> it later so you
can run multiple futures concurrently.</p>
<p>As I suggested in the start of this book, visiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200207092849/https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/31/build-your-own-executor.html">@stjepan'sblog series about implementing your own executors</a>

<p>Right now it will deadlock since our <code>poll</code> method thinks the first poll of
<code>future2</code> is <code>future1</code> getting polled again and swaps out the waker with the
one from <code>future2</code>. This waker never gets called since the task is never
registered.</p>
<p>It's probably a bad idea to expose the user to this behavior, so we
should have a unique Id for each task which we use internally. There are a
many ways to solve this. Below is two suggestions to get going:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let the reactor have a <code>usize</code> which is incremented on every task creation</li>
<li>Use a crate like <code>Guid</code> to generate an unique Id for each task</li>
</ol>
